# MeteroidsLanding
This is a geospatial project where I answered few questions in the [data card](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nasa/meteorite-landings)

1. how does the geographical distribution of observed falls differ from that of found meteorites?
2. Are there any geographical differences or differences over time in the class of meteorites that have fallen to Earth?
